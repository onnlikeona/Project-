# Project

This repository includes the code and data that used in the project "Detecting Regime Shifts". Rodionov's (2006) Microsoft Excel Add-In, Shift-detection v3-2, was used to compute the RSI and RSSI values for both the simulated and real data and can be accessed here: https://www.beringclimate.noaa.gov/regimes/. The excel results along with a few graphs plotted in excel for demonstration can be found under "SIMULATIONS RESULTS" for the simulated data. These results (array A1:H1001) were then exported to R under the 'sim_stars_results' object.
